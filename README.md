# Crop Recommendation Model

This project is a machine learning-based web application that helps predict the most suitable crop for a specific location based on various input factors.


Developed the front-end using HTML and CSS, with back-end integration using Django.
The application allows users to input data such as:
Location (select district),
pH value of the soil,
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium levels,
The machine learning model then predicts the most suitable crop for the given conditions.
Weather information is fetched using the OpenWeatherMap API to enhance crop prediction based on local weather conditions.
This project provides valuable insights to help farmers and agricultural professionals make better crop selection decisions based on soil and weather data.
